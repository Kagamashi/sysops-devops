## GitOps Principles and How ArgoCD Fits In

ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It follows GitOps principles, ensuring that the desired application state is always stored in Git and automatically reconciled with the cluster. Key GitOps principles include:

- **Declarative Configuration** – The desired state of applications and infrastructure is described in Git using YAML manifests or Helm charts.
- **Version Control as the Source of Truth** – Git repositories serve as the ultimate reference point for application deployment, rollback, and auditing.
- **Automated Synchronization** – ArgoCD continuously monitors the Git repository and the cluster, applying changes automatically to keep them in sync.
- **Observability and Security** – Provides a real-time view of application states and supports RBAC and SSO integrations.
