# template.sync-failed: Defines the content and format of the notification that is sent when a sync fails.

# slack.title: The title of the Slack notification.
# slack.body: The body of the Slack notification, which also includes dynamic variables.
# template.sync-succeeded: Defines the notification content for when a sync succeeds. Similar to the failure template, it contains dynamic information about the application's sync status.
