- Real-time analytics and BI reporting.

### **Data Path Strategies (Hot, Warm, Cold)**
Different data paths are used based on latency and access requirements.

#### **Hot Data Path**
- Real-time analytics and immediate data consumption.
- Uses Azure Stream Analytics and Event Hubs.
- Example: Real-time fraud detection, IoT monitoring.

#### **Warm Data Path**
- Near real-time data analysis with slight delay.
- Uses Azure SQL Database and Azure Cosmos DB.
- Example: Customer activity tracking, transactional analytics.

#### **Cold Data Path**
- Long-term storage for historical data and batch analytics.
- Uses Azure Data Lake Storage and Azure Blob Storage.
- Example: Compliance data retention, machine learning training.

### **Azure Stream Analytics**
A fully managed event-processing engine for real-time analytics on streaming data.

#### **Features:**
- Supports input from IoT devices, logs, and telemetry data.
- Uses SQL-like query language for filtering and aggregating data.
- Outputs to Power BI, Cosmos DB, and Azure Storage.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Geospatial analytics and real-time telemetry processing.
- Fraud detection in financial transactions.
- Predictive maintenance and IoT monitoring.

### **Conclusion**
Azure provides a comprehensive suite of data integration and analytics tools for organizations to process, analyze, and derive insights from structured and unstructured data. Choosing the right combination of services depends on workload requirements, latency expectations, and business objectives.
