## Azure Backup and Recovery Summary

### **Design for Backup and Recovery**
Ensuring mission-critical applications remain reliable and recoverable is essential. Backup and disaster recovery strategies must align with business needs, workload usage, availability requirements, and service-level agreements (SLAs).

#### **Key Considerations:**
- **Workload Identification**: Define critical workloads and their availability needs.
- **Recovery Metrics**: Establish **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** (max downtime tolerated) and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** (max acceptable data loss).
- **Availability Targets**: Define SLAs for workloads.
- **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Plans**: Implement resilient architecture across multiple regions when necessary.

### **Azure Backup Overview**
Azure Backup provides a scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud backup solution for various workloads. It eliminates the need for physical backup media and supports multiple data types.

#### **Backup Types:**
- **On-Premises**: Backup files, folders, and system states using MARS agent or Azure Backup Server (MABS).
- **Azure Virtual Machines**: Backup entire Windows/Linux VMs using backup extensions.
- **Azure Files**: Backup Azure file shares.
- **SQL Server in Azure VMs**: Backup SQL Server databases.
- **SAP HANA in Azure VMs**: Backup SAP HANA databases.

### **Azure Backup Storage Vaults**
- **Azure Backup Vault**: Stores Azure Database for PostgreSQL backups, Azure blobs, and disks.
- **Azure Recovery Services Vault**: Stores VM backups, SQL/SAP HANA backups, and file shares.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Organize vaults based on workloads and subscriptions.
  - Use **Azure Policy** for consistent backup settings.
  - Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to protect vaults.
  - Choose between **Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)** and **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)** for resilience.

### **Azure Blob Backup and Recovery**
Azure Blob Storage offers operational backups that store backup data within the source storage account.
- **Soft Delete**: Retains deleted blobs for a configurable period (1-365 days).
- **Blob Versioning**: Keeps previous versions of blobs to recover from unintended modifications.
- **Point-in-Time Restore**: Restores blob states to a previous timestamp.
- **Resource Locks**: Prevent accidental deletions or modifications.

### **Azure Files Backup and Recovery**
- **Share Snapshots**: Capture the state of Azure file shares at specific points.
- **Automated Backup**: Use Azure Backup for automatic daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly snapshots.
- **Instant Restore**: Quickly recover individual files from snapshots.
- **Self-Service Restore**: Allow advanced users to restore files independently.

### **Azure Virtual Machine Backup and Recovery**
Azure Backup provides independent and isolated backups for VMs.
- **Backup Workflow**:
  1. Take a **snapshot** of the VM.
  2. Transfer the snapshot to a **Recovery Services Vault**.
- **Backup Frequency**: Supports both scheduled and on-demand backups.
- **Backup Encryption**: Data is encrypted using **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)**.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Distribute backups at different times to prevent traffic congestion.
  - Use **Cross-Region Restore (CRR)** for disaster recovery.
  - Test restores periodically to ensure reliability.

### **Azure SQL Backup and Recovery**
Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance support **automated backups**:
- **Full Backups**: Weekly.
- **Differential Backups**: Every 12-24 hours.
- **Transactional Backups**: Every 5-10 minutes.
- **Recovery Options**:
  - **Point-in-Time Restore**: Restore to any moment within retention.
  - **Geo-Restore**: Recover from a different Azure region in case of regional outages.
  - **Long-Term Retention (LTR)**: Store backups in **geo-redundant storage** for up to **10 years**.

### **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**
Azure Site Recovery enhances business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) for applications running on Azure and on-premises.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Replicate **Azure Virtual Machines** to a secondary region.
  - Replicate **On-Premises VMs** (Hyper-V, VMware, physical servers) to Azure.
  - Automate failovers with recovery plans.
  - Ensure minimal RTO and RPO for disaster scenarios.
  - Conduct failover **test drills** without impacting production.
  - Integrate with **Azure Backup** for a comprehensive BCDR strategy.

### **Conclusion**
A well-structured backup and recovery strategy in Azure ensures **resilience, high availability, and minimal downtime** for mission-critical applications. Organizations should:
- Define **RTO/RPO** for workloads.
- Select **appropriate backup types** based on business needs.
- Implement **Azure Backup and Site Recovery** for BCDR.
- Regularly **test restore operations** and monitor backup performance.

By leveraging Azureâ€™s robust backup and recovery solutions, organizations can safeguard their data and maintain seamless operations even in the face of disruptions.
