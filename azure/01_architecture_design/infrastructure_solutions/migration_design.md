**Azure Migration Summary**

## **Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure**
The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework provides best practices, documentation, and tools to support cloud adoption in organizations. It includes methodologies for:
- **Strategy**: Define cloud adoption goals.
- **Plan**: Prepare for migration.
- **Ready**: Establish organizational structure and governance.
- **Adopt**: Migrate and modernize workloads.
- **Govern & Manage**: Ensure security and operational control.

### **Migration Adoption Phases**
1. **Assess**: Evaluate workloads for migration costs, modernization needs, and deployment tools.
2. **Deploy**: Replicate or improve workloads in the cloud.
3. **Release**: Optimize, document, and hand over workloads for ongoing management.

## **Azure Migration Framework**
A structured approach to cloud migration consisting of four stages:
1. **Assess**: Identify apps, servers, and dependencies. Use Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator to estimate costs.
2. **Migrate**: Deploy infrastructure, migrate workloads, and decommission on-premises systems.
3. **Optimize**: Analyze costs, implement cost-saving recommendations, and improve performance.
4. **Monitor**: Use Azure Monitor to track health and performance, set alerts, and automate scaling.

### **Migration Strategies**
- **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**: Move workloads without changes.
- **Refactor**: Make minimal changes to leverage PaaS features.
- **Rearchitect**: Modify apps for cloud scalability.
- **Rebuild**: Develop cloud-native applications.

## **Assessing On-Premises Workloads**
Azure provides tools to assess workloads before migration:
- **Service Map**: Identifies server dependencies and application connections.
- **Azure TCO Calculator**: Estimates cost savings post-migration.
- **Azure Migrate**: Assesses virtual machines, databases, and applications for migration readiness.

## **Migration Tools**
### **Azure Migrate**
- Centralized hub for migration planning and execution.
- Includes tools for servers, databases, applications, and data.
- Supports agentless discovery and performance-based sizing.

### **Azure Resource Mover**
- Moves Azure resources between subscriptions, resource groups, and regions.
- Simplifies resource organization before and after migration.

---

## **Database Migration**
Azure Database Migration Service supports structured data migration to:
- Azure Virtual Machines (SQL Server)
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure SQL Managed Instance
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL

**Migration Process:**
1. **Assess databases** using Data Migration Assistant (DMA).
2. **Migrate schema** before data transfer.
3. **Migrate data** and verify its integrity.

## **Unstructured Data Migration**
### **Azure Storage Mover**
- Migrates SMB and NFS file shares.
- Maintains file metadata and ACLs.
- Uses migration agents near the source storage.

### **Azure File Sync**
- Synchronizes on-premises file shares with Azure Files.
- Supports lift-and-shift migrations.
- Used for distributed caching and disaster recovery.

---

## **Offline Data Migration**
### **Azure Import/Export Service**
- Ships physical disks to Azure datacenters.
- Supports bulk migration, backup, and recovery.
- Requires BitLocker encryption and a shipping carrier.

### **Azure Data Box**
- Provides a physical, tamper-proof device for data migration.
- Supports initial bulk transfers and periodic uploads.
- Available in different sizes (Data Box, Data Box Disk, Data Box Heavy).

**Comparison:**
| Feature | Azure Import/Export | Azure Data Box |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| Form Factor | Internal SATA HDDs/SSDs | Secure, tamper-proof device |
| Managed Shipping | No | Yes |
| Partner Integrations | No | Yes |
| Custom Appliance | No | Yes |

## **Conclusion**
Azure provides a comprehensive framework and tools to facilitate smooth cloud migration. Organizations can leverage various migration strategies, tools, and methodologies based on workload requirements to ensure an efficient transition to Azure.
