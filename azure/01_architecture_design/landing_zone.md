## Azure Landing Zones Summary

### Overview
Azure landing zones provide a structured environment for deploying workloads while ensuring foundational services like networking, identity management, policies, and monitoring are in place beforehand.

#### Key Points:
- Landing zones act as pre-configured infrastructure environments.
- They include management groups and subscriptions that scale with business needs.
- Azure policies ensure continued compliance within landing zones.
- Deployment is typically done via Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- The **Azure landing zone accelerator** provides an automated setup within an existing Microsoft Entra tenant.

### Considerations for Using Landing Zones

#### **Incorporating Landing Zones in Your Design**
- Utilize subscriptions as management units aligned with business priorities.
- Implement Azure Policy guardrails to maintain compliance.

#### **Creating Landing Zones via Code**
- Landing zones should be provisioned through code.
- Use an iterative approach to minimize refactoring and maximize learning.
- Engage a central IT team to ensure both short- and long-term alignment.

#### **Using the Azure Landing Zone Accelerator**
- The accelerator provides a predefined architecture with best-practice configurations.
- Supports management groups, policies, and compliance settings.

#### **Application-Centric Approach**
- Focus on modern application deployments rather than traditional lift-and-shift migrations.
- Prioritize Azure-native services for better integration and future-proofing.

#### **Scalability for Migrations and Greenfield Deployments**
- Landing zones should support both migration scenarios and new (greenfield) deployments.
- This ensures consistency across the entire IT portfolio beyond short-term cloud adoption.

#### **Integrating with Existing Azure Architectures**
- Existing environments can transition to Azure landing zones.
- The accelerator can be deployed in parallel with current architectures.

### Best Practices
- **Review Landing Zones Regularly:** Conduct assessments to ensure alignment with organizational goals.
- **Adopt an Iterative Approach:** Start small and scale as needed.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Use Azure Policy to enforce security and operational standards.
- **Engage Stakeholders:** Collaborate with various teams to define landing zone strategies.

Azure landing zones provide a solid foundation for governance, scalability, and security, enabling organizations to efficiently manage their cloud environments.
