Key Security Components:

Azure Firewall: Centralized network traffic control.

DDoS Protection: Protect against distributed denial-of-service attacks.

Web Application Firewall (WAF): Protect web applications against OWASP threats.

Network Security Groups (NSGs): Control inbound/outbound traffic at the subnet or NIC level.

Private Link & Service Endpoints: Securely connect to Azure services over private networks.

Best Practices:

Enable DDoS Protection Standard for critical applications.

Restrict inbound internet traffic using Azure Firewall and NSGs.

Use Private Endpoints to secure Azure service access.

Implement Zero Trust Segmentation with NSGs and Azure Firewall.
