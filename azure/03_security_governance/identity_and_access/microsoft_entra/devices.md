## **Types of Microsoft Entra Devices**
Microsoft Entra ID supports three types of device identities:

### **1. Microsoft Entra Registered Devices** (BYOD)
- Designed for **personal devices** (Bring Your Own Device - BYOD).
- Users sign in with **local credentials** (PIN, biometrics) and attach a Microsoft Entra account.
- Used for accessing **Microsoft Entra ID-controlled resources** securely.
- **Managed via** MDM tools like Microsoft Intune.

✅ **Use Case:** Users accessing work apps from personal laptops or mobile devices.

### **2. Microsoft Entra Joined Devices** (Cloud-Only)
- Intended for **cloud-first organizations** without on-premises Active Directory.
- Devices are **fully joined** to Microsoft Entra ID, requiring an **organizational account** to sign in.
- Supports **SSO** for both **cloud and on-premises resources**.
- **Managed via** Intune or Endpoint Configuration Manager.

✅ **Use Case:** Employees using corporate-owned devices for accessing SaaS applications.

### **3. Hybrid Microsoft Entra Joined Devices** (On-Prem + Cloud)
- Devices are **joined to both on-prem AD and Microsoft Entra ID**.
- Supports **traditional Group Policy** management.
- Provides **SSO for both cloud and on-prem resources**.
- Works with **Configuration Manager or Intune**.

✅ **Use Case:** Organizations transitioning to cloud while maintaining on-prem infrastructure.

## **Device Writeback** (Hybrid Scenarios)
- **Device Writeback** syncs Microsoft Entra registered devices to **on-premises Active Directory**.
- Enables **Conditional Access** policies in hybrid setups.
- Required for **Windows Hello for Business (WHFB)** in hybrid environments.
- Helps **Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)** issue claims based on device state.

✅ **Use Case:** Restricting access to corporate apps based on device compliance.

---

## **Enrollment Methods**
- **Microsoft Entra Registration:** Self-service enrollment through device settings.
- **Microsoft Entra Join:** Done during Out of Box Experience (OOBE), Windows Autopilot, or bulk enrollment.
- **Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join:** Requires **Microsoft Entra Connect** and Group Policy setup.
