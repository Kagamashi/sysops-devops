# Defense-in-Depth Security Strategy

## Overview
**Defense-in-depth** is a security strategy that employs multiple layers of protection to **prevent unauthorized access** to data. Each layer functions as a safeguard, ensuring that if one layer is breached, others remain intact to mitigate threats.

## Layers of Defense-in-Depth
Security is structured into **multiple layers**, with data at the core and each outer layer adding protection. The layers include:

### 1. **Physical Security**
- Protects computing hardware in datacenters.
- Uses physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and theft.

### 2. **Identity and Access**
- Controls access to infrastructure and data.
- Uses **Single Sign-On (SSO)**, **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**, and access auditing.

### 3. **Perimeter Security**
- Uses **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection** to prevent large-scale attacks.
- Implements perimeter firewalls to detect and block malicious activity.

### 4. **Network Security**
- Limits communication between resources via segmentation and access controls.
- Uses a **default deny** policy for unauthorized traffic.
- Restricts inbound and outbound internet access where necessary.

### 5. **Compute Security**
- Ensures virtual machines and workloads are protected.
- Uses **endpoint protection**, patching, and system updates to minimize vulnerabilities.

### 6. **Application Security**
- Ensures applications are built with security in mind.
- Protects **application secrets** by storing them securely.
- Identifies and remediates vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle.

### 7. **Data Security**
- Controls access to sensitive **business and customer data**.
- Ensures compliance with regulatory requirements for **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.
- Protects data stored in databases, virtual machines, SaaS applications, and cloud storage.

## Key Takeaways
- **Layered security** prevents reliance on a single defense mechanism.
- **Mitigates attacks** by slowing them down and providing alerts.
- **Azure offers built-in tools** for securing each layer, ensuring comprehensive protection.

By implementing a **defense-in-depth** strategy, organizations can **enhance security, reduce risk, and protect critical assets** effectively.
