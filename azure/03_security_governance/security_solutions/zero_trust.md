# Zero Trust Security Model

## Overview
Zero Trust is a **security model** that assumes breaches are inevitable and verifies every request as if it originates from an **untrusted network**. It is designed to adapt to the complexities of modern security challenges by securing **people, devices, applications, and data** regardless of their location.

## Core Principles
1. **Verify Explicitly**
   - Always authenticate and authorize based on **all available data points** (e.g., user identity, device health, location, etc.).
2. **Use Least Privilege Access**
   - Implement **Just-In-Time (JIT)** and **Just-Enough-Access (JEA)** policies.
   - Enforce **risk-based adaptive access** and data protection.
3. **Assume Breach**
   - Minimize blast radius and segment access.
   - Enforce **end-to-end encryption**.
   - Use analytics to detect threats and strengthen defenses.

## Shifting to Zero Trust
- **Traditional networks** assumed internal devices were safe by default.
- **Zero Trust requires authentication for every request**, regardless of the deviceâ€™s location.
- **Access is granted based on authentication rather than network location.**

## Summary
Zero Trust **eliminates implicit trust**, ensuring security by continuously verifying users, devices, and access permissions. This model provides **enhanced protection** against modern cyber threats while enabling a secure, mobile workforce.
