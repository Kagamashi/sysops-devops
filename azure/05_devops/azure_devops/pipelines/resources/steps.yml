# STEPS are individual units of work inside a job 
# These can be scripts, tasks, checkout steps 
# Step is an atomic action in the pipeline 

# Key types of steps: 
# script: executes shell or PowerShell script 
# task: runs a predefined Azure DevOps task (e.g. Maven@3 etc) 
# checkout: checks out code from the repository 
# download: downloads artifacts from other stages or pipelines 

###

# example using a script step
steps:
  - script: echo "Building the code"
    displayName: 'Build Step'

# example using a task
steps:
  - task: Npm@1
    inputs:
      command: 'install'

# example using checkout
steps:
  - checkout: self  # Checks out the current repository

# example using download artifact
steps:
  - download: current  # Downloads artifacts from a previous stage

# steps can have conditions (the same way as jobs)
steps:
  - script: echo "Running this step"
    condition: succeeded()
