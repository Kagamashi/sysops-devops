# .gitignore Guide

The `.gitignore` file is used to specify which files and directories Git should ignore in a repository. It is especially useful for excluding sensitive files, build artifacts, and temporary files from version control.

## Key Points

### 1. Files Already Tracked by Git
- **Important**: Files already tracked by Git will not be affected by `.gitignore`.
- **To stop tracking a file that was previously committed:**
  ```bash
  git rm --cached <file_name>
  ```

### 2. Global `.gitignore`
- You can create a global `.gitignore` file to exclude system-specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store` on macOS) across all repositories.
- **Set up a global `.gitignore` file:**
  ```bash
  git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
  ```
