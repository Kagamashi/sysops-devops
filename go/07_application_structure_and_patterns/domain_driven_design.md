# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software design approach focused on modeling software based on the real-world domain. It helps manage complex business logic by structuring the application around domain models.

## Key Principles:
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Use the same terminology across business & development.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Divide the system into smaller, well-defined domains.
- **Aggregates & Entities**: Define how objects are grouped and identified.
- **Repositories & Services**: Separate persistence concerns from domain logic.
- **Value Objects**: Immutable, lightweight objects used within domain models.
