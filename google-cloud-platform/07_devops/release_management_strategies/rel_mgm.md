# Release Management Strategies

## 1. Overview
Release management in Google Cloud ensures **safe, controlled deployments** using strategies like **Canary, Blue-Green deployments, and Progressive Delivery**. These techniques reduce downtime, mitigate risks, and enable automated rollbacks when issues arise.

---

## 2. Canary Deployments
A **Canary deployment** gradually rolls out a new version to a subset of users before a full release.

### **Key Benefits**
- Detects issues before full rollout.
- Reduces impact of failed releases.
- Enables controlled traffic shifting.

### **Canary Deployment on GKE**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-canary
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        track: canary
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: gcr.io/my-project/my-app:v2
```

### **Shifting Traffic with a Service in GKE**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  traffic:
  - revisionName: my-app-v1
    percent: 80
  - revisionName: my-app-v2
    percent: 20
```

## 3. Blue-Green Deployments
A **Blue-Green deployment** runs two environments (**blue = live, green = new**) and switches traffic between them.

### **Key Benefits**
- Immediate rollback capability.
- Zero downtime deployment.
- No impact on live users until testing is complete.

### **Blue-Green Deployment in App Engine**
```sh
gcloud app services set-traffic my-service \
  --splits blue=0.0,green=1.0
```

### **Blue-Green Deployment in Cloud Run**
```sh
gcloud run services update-traffic my-service \
  --to-revisions=my-app-v2=100
```

---

## 4. Automated Rollbacks
Google Cloud enables **automated rollbacks** when errors are detected.

### **Rollback a GKE Deployment**
```sh
kubectl rollout undo deployment my-app
```

### **Rollback a Cloud Run Service**
```sh
gcloud run services update-traffic my-service \
  --to-revisions=my-app-v1=100
```

### **Rollback an App Engine Deployment**
```sh
gcloud app versions migrate my-app-v1
```

---

## 5. Progressive Delivery
Progressive delivery enables **gradual rollouts based on real-time performance feedback**.

### **Key Strategies**
âœ… Use **traffic splitting** in App Engine and Cloud Run.  
âœ… Implement **automatic rollback policies** based on logs and metrics.  
âœ… Monitor SLOs and SLIs before scaling a new release.  
âœ… Use **feature flags** for granular release control.  

---

## 6. Final Checklist
âœ… Choose **Canary deployments** for safer incremental rollouts.  
âœ… Use **Blue-Green deployments** for near-instant rollbacks.  
âœ… Automate **rollback triggers** for failed deployments.  
âœ… Implement **progressive delivery** to monitor new releases before scaling.  
âœ… Ensure proper **monitoring and logging integration** for release observability.
