# Resilience feature in Istio that protects services from cascading failures by limiting the amount of traffic sent to a struggling service.
# When a service becomes overwhelmed or starts failing, Istio circuit breaker limits request to that service, helping it recover and preventing system-wide issues.

# - Connection Limits: Control the maximum number of connections to a service.
# - Request Limits: Set a limit on the number of concurrent requests allowed to a service.
# - Retries and Failover: Automatically retry failed requests or route traffic to healthy instances if a circuit is "open."
