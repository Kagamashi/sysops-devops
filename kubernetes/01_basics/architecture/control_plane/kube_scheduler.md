### **Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`)**
- Assigns Pods to nodes based on **resource availability**, **affinity rules**, and **constraints**.
- Works with **Node Selectors, Taints & Tolerations, and Affinity Rules**.
- Uses a **scoring system** (e.g., Least-Loaded Node, Inter-Pod Affinity) for optimal scheduling.
