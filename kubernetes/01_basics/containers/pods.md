## **Best Practices**
- **Use minimal base images** (`distroless`, `alpine`, `scratch`) for security.
- **Leverage multi-stage builds** to reduce attack surface.
- **Prefer non-root containers** and define user contexts (`USER 1000` in Dockerfile).
- **Use ephemeral Pods** whenever possible and rely on external persistent storage.
- **Choose the right container runtime**: containerd for standard Kubernetes deployments, CRI-O for OpenShift environments.

## **Pod vs. Container: Deep Dive**

A **container** is the execution unit inside a Pod, while a **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. Unlike a standalone container (e.g., `docker run`), a Pod can encapsulate multiple containers that share **network, storage, and metadata**.

### **Key Differences & Architectural Implications**

| **Aspect**        | **Container**                                     | **Pod**                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | Self-contained execution environment.            | A wrapper around one or more containers.             |
| **Networking**    | Has its own network namespace.                    | Containers share the same **Pod network namespace**.  |
| **Storage**       | Ephemeral unless mounted.                         | Shared volumes among containers.                     |
| **Lifecycle**     | Managed independently by the runtime.             | Orchestrated by Kubernetes control plane.            |
| **Scaling**       | Requires manual handling (`docker run`).          | Managed via `kubectl scale` or HPA.                  |
| **Communication** | External networking required.                     | Containers communicate via `localhost`.              |

## **Advanced Pod Design Patterns**

### **1. Sidecar Pattern**
- A helper container runs alongside the main container to **extend functionality** (e.g., logging agent, service mesh proxy).
- Example: Envoy as a **sidecar proxy** in Istio.

### **2. Ambassador Pattern**
- A container acts as a proxy to manage communication to external services (e.g., Redis Proxy).

### **3. Adapter Pattern**
- Transforms data formats between services within a Pod (e.g., telemetry format conversion).
