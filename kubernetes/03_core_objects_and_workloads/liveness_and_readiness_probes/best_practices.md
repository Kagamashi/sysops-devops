## **Best Practices for Microservices Health Checks**
### **1. Use Separate Endpoints for Probes**
- Create dedicated `/healthz` (liveness) and `/ready` (readiness) endpoints.
- Avoid using the same endpoint for both probes to prevent unintended restarts.

### **2. Implement Proper Startup Handling**
- Use **`initialDelaySeconds`** to prevent premature failures during container startup.
- Use `startupProbe` for long initialization applications (available from Kubernetes 1.16+):
```yaml
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /startup
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30  # Allow up to 5 minutes (30 * 10s) to start
  periodSeconds: 10
```

### **3. Set Meaningful Thresholds**
- **Use `failureThreshold`** to prevent unnecessary restarts for temporary failures.
- **Set `successThreshold` >1** for readiness probes to prevent premature traffic routing.

### **4. Avoid Expensive Health Checks**
- Do **not** run database queries or external API calls inside a health check.
- Keep the health check logic lightweight and fast.

### **5. Ensure Application Self-Healing**
- If an application can **recover on its own**, consider longer `failureThreshold` values.
- If an application **requires a restart to recover**, use a **liveness probe**.
