# ANNOTATIONS specific to AzureLoadBalancer integration with AKS cluster
# this setup is used when:
# - exposing services internally within a private network (for backend services, databases, internal APIs)
# - avoiding public exposure for security reasons
# - ensuring a predictable private IP for the service

# Istio Ingress Gateway (which acts as entry point for external traffic) can be exposed via internal Load Balancer instead of public one.
# These annotations can be applied to Istio IngressGateway service to ensure it gets a static private IP inside a specific subnet.

  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4: 10.256.214.32
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet: "snet_lb_vnet_dh_01_tn"
  name: istio-ingressgateway
  namespace: istio-system

# service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4:
#   - This annotation specifies a static private IP address (10.255.213.36) to be assigned to the Azure Load Balancer for the Service.
#   - If this annotation is not set, Azure assigns a dynamic IP from the subnet.

# service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal:
#   - This ensures that the Load Balancer is internal (private) rather than public.
#   - A public Load Balancer would expose the service to the internet, but this ensures it's only reachable within the VNET.

# service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet:
#   - This annotation specifies the subnet name (snet_akk1_lb_vnet_dh_01_tn) within the Virtual Network (VNET) where the Load Balancerâ€™s private IP should be assigned.
#   - This is important when you want the Load Balancer to reside in a specific subnet, for example, one with custom NSGs, UDRs, or a well-defined CIDR range.
