
## **Ephemeral Volumes**
Ephemeral volumes are removed when a Pod is deleted. They are useful for temporary storage needs.

- Avoid hostPath in productiona as it stricly ties a Pod to specific Node

### **Common Ephemeral Volume Types:**
| Volume Type | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **emptyDir** | A temporary directory that exists as long as the Pod is running. | Scratch space for applications that require temporary storage. |
| **hostPath** | Mounts a file or directory from the host nodeâ€™s filesystem into a Pod. | Accessing host machine resources, such as logs or Docker socket. |
| **configMap & secret** | Mounts Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets as files inside the container. | Storing sensitive configuration data securely. |
| **downwardAPI** | Exposes metadata (Pod name, labels) as a file inside the container. | Applications needing runtime metadata information. |

### **Example: Using emptyDir**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ephemeral-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/cache"
      name: cache-volume
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

### **Example: Using hostPath**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hostpath-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/var/log"
      name: log-volume
  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    hostPath:
      path: "/var/log"
      type: Directory
```

## **Comparison of Volume Types**

| Volume Type | Persistence | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **emptyDir** | No | Temporary storage shared between containers in a Pod |
| **hostPath** | No | Accessing host machine resources (e.g., logs) |
| **Persistent Volume (PV)** | Yes | Long-term storage backed by physical disk/cloud storage |
| **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** | Yes | Dynamic request for storage by Pods |
| **StorageClass** | Yes | Automates volume provisioning for cloud-native workloads |
