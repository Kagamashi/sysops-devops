# argocd-tls-cm

# Configures TLS settings for securing communication between ArgoCD components and external services (e.g. repositories, clusters) 
#   - custom/self-signed certificates

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-tls-cm  # ConfigMap for managing trusted TLS certificates
  namespace: argocd  # The namespace where ArgoCD is installed
data:
  # Each entry is the base64-encoded PEM certificate of a trusted certificate authority (CA)
  
  # Example 1: GitHub Enterprise Custom CA
  github-enterprise.com: |  # Hostname of the service (Git repository, Helm repo, etc.)
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAIBf...  # Base64-encoded PEM certificate
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  
  # Example 2: Self-Hosted GitLab CA
  gitlab.mycompany.com: |  # The hostname of the GitLab instance
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAIBf...  # The custom CA certificate for GitLab
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    
  # Example 3: Private Helm Repository CA
  helm.mycompany.com: |  # The hostname of the Helm repository
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAIBf...  # The custom CA certificate for the Helm repository
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

# metadata.name: The name of the ConfigMap, which is always argocd-tls-cm for managing trusted TLS certificates in ArgoCD.
# metadata.namespace: The namespace where ArgoCD is installed (typically argocd).
# data: This section contains the actual TLS certificates. Each entry in this section is:
# <hostname>: The hostname of the service (e.g., Git repository, Helm repository) that uses the custom or self-signed certificate. ArgoCD will use this certificate when interacting with that specific hostname.
# <certificate>: The base64-encoded PEM certificate for the service's certificate authority (CA). This is the CA that ArgoCD will trust when interacting with the specified service.
