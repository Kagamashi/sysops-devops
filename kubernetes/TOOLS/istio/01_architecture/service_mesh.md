
## **Service Mesh Concept**
A **Service Mesh** is an infrastructure layer that manages communication between microservices in a distributed system. It provides:
- **Traffic control**: Fine-grained traffic routing and load balancing.
- **Security**: Mutual TLS, authentication, and authorization.
- **Observability**: Tracing, logging, and monitoring of service-to-service communication.
- **Reliability**: Fault injection, retries, and circuit breaking.

## **Problems Solved by Istio**
Istio addresses several challenges in microservices environments:
- **Service-to-service communication**: Secure, reliable, and observable traffic routing.
- **Security**: Enforces authentication, authorization, and encryption without modifying application code.
- **Traffic Management**: Enables blue-green deployments, canary releases, and traffic mirroring.
- **Observability**: Provides insights into request flows with metrics, logs, and distributed tracing.
