**# WASM Extensions and Envoy Filters in Istio**

## **Customizing Envoy Behavior with WASM Filters**
WebAssembly (WASM) extensions allow dynamic customization of **Envoy proxies** in Istio without rebuilding or redeploying the proxy. These filters can modify traffic, implement security policies, or perform request transformation.

### **How WASM Works in Istio**
1. **A WASM filter is developed** in languages like Rust, C++, or AssemblyScript.
2. **The filter is compiled** into a `.wasm` binary.
3. **Envoy loads the WASM module** dynamically at runtime.
4. **Traffic is processed** through the filter before reaching services.

### **Deploying a WASM Filter in Istio**
1. **Build and upload the WASM module**:
   ```sh
   docker build -t my-wasm-filter .
   docker push my-wasm-filter:latest
   ```
2. **Deploy the WASM filter as an Envoy extension**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
   kind: WasmPlugin
   metadata:
     name: my-wasm-plugin
     namespace: istio-system
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         istio: ingressgateway
     url: oci://my-registry/my-wasm-filter:latest
     phase: AUTHZ
   ```
3. **Apply the configuration**:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f wasm-plugin.yaml
   ```
4. **Verify WASM filter is active**:
   ```sh
   kubectl logs -l istio=ingressgateway -n istio-system
   ```

## **Use Cases for Advanced Traffic Manipulation**
### **1. Custom Authentication and Authorization**
- Implement fine-grained **custom authentication** (e.g., validating tokens with external systems).
- Enforce **advanced authorization policies** based on user roles or request attributes.

### **2. Request and Response Transformation**
- Modify headers, query parameters, or request bodies before reaching the application.
- Sanitize sensitive data from responses before returning to clients.

### **3. Traffic Shaping and Rate Limiting**
- Control request rates per client or user to prevent abuse.
- Apply intelligent **traffic throttling** or API monetization policies.

### **4. Observability Enhancements**
- Inject custom **tracing headers** or enrich logs with additional metadata.
- Implement fine-grained **metrics collection** beyond built-in Istio telemetry.

### **5. Security and Compliance**
- Perform **DLP (Data Loss Prevention)** by scanning outbound traffic.
- Implement **custom logging and monitoring** for compliance regulations.

## **Conclusion**
- **WASM filters extend Envoy functionality dynamically** without modifying Istio core components.
- **Advanced traffic manipulation** is possible using custom filters for security, performance, and observability.
- **Deploying WASM filters in Istio** allows fine-tuned control over request flow and policy enforcement.

By leveraging **WASM and Envoy filters**, teams can achieve **highly customized traffic control and security** in their service mesh.
