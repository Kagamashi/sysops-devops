
## **What is Jaeger?**
Jaeger is an **open-source distributed tracing system** developed by Uber. It helps with monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based architectures by tracking request flows across distributed components.

### **Key Features of Jaeger**
- **Distributed Tracing**: Enables visualization of request propagation through multiple services.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identifies bottlenecks and latency issues in microservice interactions.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Helps debug failures by analyzing trace spans.
- **Service Dependency Analysis**: Maps dependencies between microservices.
- **Supports Multiple Storage Backends**: Works with Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and more.

### **How Jaeger Works in Istio**
1. **Envoy sidecars collect tracing data** and propagate trace headers.
2. **Tracing data is sent to Jaeger** for storage and analysis.
3. **Developers can visualize traces** using the Jaeger UI.

### **Enabling Jaeger in Istio**
1. **Deploy Jaeger in Istio**:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/latest/download/samples/addons/jaeger.yaml
   ```
2. **Verify Jaeger is running**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n istio-system | grep jaeger
   ```
3. **Access the Jaeger UI**:
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward -n istio-system svc/tracing 16686:80
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:16686` to explore traces.
