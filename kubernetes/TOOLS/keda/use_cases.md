# KEDA Use Cases

## Typical Scenarios
KEDA is designed to handle event-driven scaling efficiently. Here are some common use cases:

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Ideal for workloads that require processing large amounts of data in short bursts.
   - KEDA automatically scales pods up or down based on the incoming workload.
   - Example: Auto-scaling a Kubernetes Job based on the number of pending messages in an Azure Queue or Kafka topic.

2. **Event-Driven Triggers**
   - Enables Kubernetes workloads to react to external events without running continuously.
   - Example: Scaling an application based on database changes, HTTP requests, or webhook events.

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Scales down to zero when there is no demand, reducing resource costs.
   - Example: Running serverless workloads without the need for a full-fledged FaaS solution.

## High-Level Examples

1. **Scaling Microservices Based on Queue Length**
   - Use case: An e-commerce platform with an order processing service.
   - KEDA monitors a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus) and scales the order processing pods based on pending messages.

2. **Autoscaling Webhooks and API Consumers**
   - Use case: A system processing external webhooks.
   - KEDA triggers pod scaling based on incoming HTTP requests or API rate limits.

3. **Dynamic Video Processing Pipelines**
   - Use case: A video streaming platform that encodes videos in the background.
   - KEDA scales encoding jobs based on the number of unprocessed video files in storage.

4. **IoT Data Processing**
   - Use case: A real-time analytics system for IoT sensors.
   - KEDA scales data processing services based on the volume of incoming sensor data from sources like MQTT or Kafka.

KEDAâ€™s event-driven approach makes it a flexible and efficient choice for scaling workloads dynamically, reducing costs, and optimizing resource usage.
