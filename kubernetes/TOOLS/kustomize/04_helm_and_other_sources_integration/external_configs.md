## **External Configurations**
Kustomize can integrate with third-party services or pull partial YAML configurations from external sources.

### **Referencing External YAML Configurations**
Some external tools provide YAML snippets that can be included in Kustomize workflows.

#### **Example: Importing a Remote ConfigMap YAML**
```yaml
resources:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example-org/config-repo/main/configmap.yaml
```

### **Using External APIs for Dynamic Configuration**
Some organizations store Kubernetes configurations in external services and fetch them dynamically.

#### **Example: Fetching Configs via a Pre-Step**
```sh
curl -o external-config.yaml https://api.example.com/config
```
```yaml
resources:
  - external-config.yaml
```

### **Best Practices for External Configurations**
- **Use versioned URLs** when referencing external YAML to ensure stability.
- **Pre-fetch configurations** in CI/CD pipelines instead of relying on live HTTP references.
- **Validate external YAML files** before applying them to Kustomize to prevent errors.

By integrating external configurations, Kustomize workflows can remain modular and adaptable while ensuring best practices in configuration management.
