Linux follows the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**, which defines a structured layout for system directories.

## **FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)**
The **FHS** ensures consistency across Linux distributions. Below are the most important directories and their purposes:

| **Directory**  | **Purpose** |
|---------------|------------|
| `/`           | Root directory (contains everything). |
| `/bin/`       | Essential user binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`). |
| `/sbin/`      | Essential system binaries (e.g., `fdisk`, `mount`, `fsck`). |
| `/etc/`       | Configuration files (e.g., `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/hosts`). |
| `/var/`       | Variable data (logs, cache, spools, temporary files). |
| `/usr/`       | User applications and utilities (non-essential binaries). |
| `/home/`      | User home directories (e.g., `/home/user`). |
| `/root/`      | Root userâ€™s home directory. |
| `/tmp/`       | Temporary files (cleared on reboot). |
| `/opt/`       | Third-party software installations. |
| `/lib/`       | Essential system libraries for `/bin` and `/sbin`. |
| `/dev/`       | Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda1` for disk partitions). |
| `/mnt/`       | Temporary mount points. |
| `/media/`     | Mount points for removable media (USB, CD/DVD). |
| `/proc/`      | Virtual filesystem for system information (processes). |
| `/sys/`       | Virtual filesystem for kernel-related information. |
| `/boot/`      | Boot loader files (kernel, GRUB configuration). |
| `/srv/`       | Data for network services (e.g., web server files). |
