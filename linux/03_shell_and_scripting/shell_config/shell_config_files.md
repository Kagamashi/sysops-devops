## **Best Practices**
✅ **Use `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`** for shell customizations (aliases, functions).  
✅ **Use `~/.profile` for environment variables** to apply them across login shells.  
✅ **Keep your aliases organized** and document them with comments.  
✅ **Test new environment variables** before making them permanent.  
✅ **Use `source ~/.bashrc`** to apply changes without restarting the terminal.

## **Shell Configuration Files**
Different shells use different configuration files to store settings and user preferences.

| File | Used By | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `~/.bashrc` | Bash | Runs for non-login interactive shells (aliases, functions, exports). |
| `~/.bash_profile` | Bash | Runs for login shells (loads `.bashrc` by default). |
| `~/.profile` | Bash, Zsh | Runs at login; used for environment variables. |
| `~/.zshrc` | Zsh | Runs for non-login interactive Zsh sessions. |
| `~/.zprofile` | Zsh | Runs at login before `.zshrc`. |

### **Editing Shell Config Files**
To modify a shell configuration file, open it with a text editor:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc  # Edit Bash configuration
nano ~/.zshrc   # Edit Zsh configuration
```
After making changes, apply them without restarting the terminal:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # Reload Bash settings
source ~/.zshrc   # Reload Zsh settings
```
