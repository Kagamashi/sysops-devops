## **Best Practices for Kernel and Module Management**
✅ **Use `sysctl` to adjust runtime parameters** but persist changes in `/etc/sysctl.conf`.  
✅ **Use `modprobe` instead of `insmod`** for loading modules (it resolves dependencies).  
✅ **Blacklisting unwanted modules** improves security and stability.  
✅ **Monitor `dmesg` logs** for kernel-related errors after modifying parameters.  
✅ **Tune kernel parameters carefully** based on workload (containers, HPC, networking).
