## "DO THE REAL THING"
### Task approach:
    1. Read problem twice to understand it
    2. Try thinking of different ways to solve the problem
    3. Think E2E of best solution based on complexity
    4. Write algorithm from patterns in drawing
    5. Code it out
    6. Try to improve it 
    7. Go through different solutions (even if answered correctly)

### Steps to getting a dream job:
    - MENTAL FOCUS
    - LEARN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
    - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
    - COMPLETE LEETCODE/PROGRAMMING PROBLEM PRACTICE
    - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONCEPTS
    - BEHAVIOURAL PRACTICE
    - BEST METHODS OF APPLYING

## Snippets:
- Duplicates -> Sets

---

## Sorting + Dict
- Iterate Dict:
```python
for k,v in d.items() --> (k,v)
    d.keys()
    d.values()
```

- Sorted returns a new sorted list from the items in the given iterable
```python
sorted(iterable,/,*,key=None,reverse=False)
print(sortex(x.items(), key = lambda y:y[1])) --> sort list, dict by value
```

- variable.sort() - only for lists with no return, permanentnly changes the variable

---

## Lambdas
lambda arguments:expressions

- sort dict by value
```
print(sorted(x.items(), key = lambda y:y[1]))
```
